# API documentation

## Introduction

API for storing and retrieving reading progress associated with a specific account. Allows for account creation and deletion.

On authenticaded endpoints when authentication fails, a redirect is issued. This is so passport-js doesn't send a 401 triggering the browsers built in authentication prompt.

## Endpoints
### /users

### `POST`
This is the endpoint intended for users to register. In the body of the request you need to include the email and password. 
This is the only endpoint that lacks authentication.

The password must be at least 6 characters and no longer then 70 characters, it must contain one uppercase, one lowercase character, one number and one special character (like !"#Â¤%&).
Emails are normalised and checked for validity and must be unique.

Example:
```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/users HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=test@test.com
&password=password1
``` 

### `PUT`
This is the endpoint intended for users to update their password. In the body of the request you need to include the new password. Account selected by authentication.

```
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/users HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic test@test.com Password1!

password=Password2!
```

### `GET`
This endpoint is used to validate the user's credentials. It is intended for the login process.

```
GET http://localhost:3100/api/users HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic test@test.com Password1!
```

### `DELETE`
This is the endpoint intended for users to delete their account and assocated saved information, currently reading progress ony. Requst must contain basic authentication of account that is intended to be deleted.

content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic test@test.com Password1!
``` 

### /books

### `POST`
This is the endpoint intended for users to saved reading progress after creating their account. In the body of the request you need to include the book paramater containing the reading progress. The data is then validated to contain only legal characters and of correct length. Requst must contain basic authentication of account.

In the body of the request you need to include the book paramater containing the reading progress. The data is then validated to contain only legal characters and of correct length.

# Program flow and structure

The start entry file is server.js. Here we have our library imports and database connection. The library [body parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) is used to parse the body of the request. [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/) is then used as middleware to authenticate the user. [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) for the mongoDB connection.

The folder models contains the schema for the database. The folder routes contains the code that the diffrent routes call to. In the [auth.js](routes/auth.js) is the folder handling the authentication using passports basic http strategy. 

Validation is the folder that controlls api input validation. [validation.js](validation/validation.js) is the function that processes the checks and halts the chain and sends back any failures.

[routes.rest](route.rest) is the file for testing the api and degugging it. It's most easily used, using the vscode pluggin [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to test the api.
